# vue-3-vite-webpart-template

This is the webpart that hosts the Vue 3 app. It is mostly just a shell and a panel of editable properties the page author can modify.

These editable properties are passed to the Vue app as HTML attributes on the $root node that surrounds the Vue app.

As this is just a template, it is not meant to be run directly. Instead, it is meant to be copied and modified to create your own webpart.
